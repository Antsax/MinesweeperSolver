# Weekly Report: 5

## What I did

This week I completely focused on making the solver. I'm happy to say this week was a success. The algorithm is completed and works as intended. It does require some testing, optimizing and a little bit of tweaking. I also wrote my first peer review. I didn't do any testing this week, simply didn't have the time and I only want to start testing after I'm completely happy with my algorithm.

## Progression

My project is progressing well. I think this week allowed me to breathe for a little bit as I was falling behind the previous week. Basically I have all the necessary components ready. Now all I need to do is to test, document and optimize. 

## What I learned

I understand how to approach problems from different perspectives. Making the algorithm wasn't a walk in the park. But at least now I know how to make a "simple" solving algorithm. I found it particularly interesting that we can defy a simple set of rules, which then apply to all scenarios that we face. I honestly didn't think the algorithm would've functioned, but I guess I was wrong.

## Problems

I faced a lot of problems this week. Integrating the algorithm into my game turned out to be much harder than I had anticipated. The most difficult part was to make the algorithm inspect only a certain part of the gmae at a time. I had to create new data structures, which means I have to create my own version of them, since I can't apply the given libraries.

## What's next

I still have a lot to do. My main focus next week will be optimizing the solver, creating the new data structures, testing and documenting. Currently the solver is solving the game too easily. I think it is receiving information that wouldn't normally be provided for a normal human. I have to see where the problem is since the solver can't solve the game every time. Also there's a lot of redundancy in the code so I have to look into that as well. But after I've fixed these problems, I'll start working on the data structures. After that testing and documenting. If I have time, I will implement the UI. I don't think that should bee too difficult since everything is already ready for it.

Time spent this week: **20 hours**
