# Weekly Report: 3

## What I did

My aim was to finish the game this week, which was a success. I left the UI side stand for now. Testing didn't process at all this week which was a dissapointment, but I didn't want to use my time testing. I focused on finishing the game. I also created my first algorithm (SuperBuilder), which heavily resembles StringBuilder. 

## Progression

I'm very happy of this weeks progression. I managed to finish the core (game) for the algorithm despite all the problems I faced. The design is so that it can easily be implemented to the UI and it is easily expandable. If I find a need to add something to the program, it will be relatively easy due to the well thought out classification. The other classes may also implement functions from different packages and classes easily, which is very satisfying. 

## What I learned

I learned how Minesweeper works. Implementing elements from the game to other applications will definitely be useful in future projects. For example the examination of neighbours and determining their value (mine or not) might come in handy.

## Problems

The biggest problem this week was creating the functionality which looks at the neihgbours and giving a value to the square under inspection. Especially difficut was making the algorithm not looking at squares that were out of bounds. 

## What's next

I'm done with expanding the game. Now all my attention and energy will go on designing and creating the algorithm and the needed datastructures. I will leave the UI for last. If I have time I'll expand and finish it. It's not my main goal at the moment, but finishing it would also be nice. But as I said, I will dedicate all my attention on implementing the algorithm and datastructures.

Time used this week: **9**
