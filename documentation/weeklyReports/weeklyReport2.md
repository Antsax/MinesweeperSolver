# Weekly Report: 2

## What I did

I spent a fair amount of time on researching and studying on the algorithm and programming the game. I found a couple of good guides which helped me move on with the project. My main focus was creating the game ASAP, but it was easier said than done. I created the core of the GUI and the logical aspect of the game. I also created some tests and documented my work a fair bit. The user is able to interact with the board, well at least somehow. I didn't spend too much time testing. I will work on that next week.

## Progression

I'm quite disappointed on my slow flow. I tried to finish the game by this week but as you can tell, it didn't go as planned. The GUI took way too much time as I have never used JPanel or JFrame before so I had to get a slight idea on what I'm actually doing.

## What I learned

Minesweeper is a fairly easy game to program, it's just the visual side of it that actually takes time, especially with JPanel. But on the bright side, I learned to use two new Java classes. 

## Problems

My main problem currently is implementing the logical aspect of the game to the interface. They need to be updated simultaneously. I need to make it so, that the interface takes all the necessary information of the board from the actual logical constructs. How I'm going to do this remains a mystery. I still have not been able to render the mines or the values of the squares on the map but hopefully I will soon.

## What's next

I have to finish the game by next week. The main idea of this course is creating an algorithm and data-structures and I haven't even begun on either one. The game is not the main focus on this project, but I need the platform for the algorithm to work with. Next week will probably be my busiest week so far. I also need to test the current classes.

Time used this week: **15 hours**
