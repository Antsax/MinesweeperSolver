# Weekly Report: 4

## What I did

This week was a little bit lazy. I started the solving algorithm but very scarcely. I had to many other things on my hands. I didn't really do much. I created the documents requested for this week and I expanded my testing as well a little bit. But as far as the big picture goes, this week was poor. I did some amount of studying as well.

## Progression

In my opinion the progression is working pretty well. I have a clear idea on how to implement the algorithm and I've studied the subject. I've created the necessary classes and implemented Maven's Jacoco to see the test coverage. I also viewed how larger gamefields affect the generation time of the algorithms.

## What I learned

How to work on the next phase, which is creating the solver. Also how to calculate the time a function needs to execute. Designing a working schedule that ensures I will progress the same amount every week was also a nice revelation.

## Problems

Creating the Jacoco test coverage. I had to put lines into the pom.xml file. Also poor scheduling. Didn't really have much time to work on the project this week.

## What's next

I'll have to catch-up this week's work. I'm going to try and finish the solver by next week and expand my testing greatly. The documents need some refining as well. A lot to do next but at least now I know how to prioritize my time and force myself to work. 

Time spent this week: **4 hours**
