# Weekly Report: 6

## What I did

This week I solved the problem I was having with the algorithm and optimized a little bit. I also tried to add a feature to enhcance the win rate of the algorithm, but it proved to bee too difficult to implement. For this reason, I decided to scratch the idea and stick with mediocre algorithm. If I were to stick on the algorithm too long, I would run out of time. I also failed to make my own data structures, which is quite disappointing.

## Progression

This week was poor on the basis of progression. I had hoped I would already start testing and finish my data structures, but it took me a lot of time to find the problem with the algorithm and trying to enhance it. 

## What I learned

A gamesolver might prove out to be more difficult than originally anticipated. Also I learned how to find a problem in one's code efficiently. 

## Problems

A lot of problems stemmed from the fact the algorithm wasn't functioning properly. When I found the source of the problem, all of the other issues vanished. This took much time however and I got discouraged a little bit. Also I was unable to implement a new functionality. I basically erased 7 hours of work, which can be seen as wasted hours.

## What's next

Data structures and new algorithm for generating the field. The field needs to be generated after a square has been clicked. I'm hoping I'll finish the data structures and algorithm this weekend. This will give me time to test and document next week.

Time spent this week: **15 hours**
