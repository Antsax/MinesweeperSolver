# Weekly Report: 1

## What I did

The main focus for this week was choosing the subject, which proved to be far more difficult than I had anticipated. I spent literally 7 hours the first day and 3 the next trying to choose the subject, accomplishing nothing. I had an obsession to make a Minesweeper solver but the more I looked into it, the more difficult it seemed to implement. The next day I asked around from a couple of friends, the course mentor and Reddit about the difficulties I was facing and whether or not I should stick with the topic. In the end, I was convinced that nothing else motivated me as much as doing this game solver, so I chose to stay with it whether it proves to function as I intend or not.

## Progression

There really wasn't much to do this week. Only the specification document and the project directory were needed. I didn't spend too much time on the project, approximately 3 hours or so.

## What I learned

I spent most of my time reading on the topic. The more I looked into it, the more intrigued I became. I quickly realized, that I could learn a lot from this assignment. I probably shouldn't have spent too much time thinking on the subject. I should have chosen Minesweeper from the get-go, but I doubted myself. Next time I see a subject I'm really passionate about, I'll take it immediately.

## Problems

I still don't know how to implement the board for the algorithm. My first idea was to use an online [Minesweeper](http://minesweeperonline.com/) but I didn't know how to make a program that could _read_ directly from the screen and determine where the board is. Some suggested making my own Minesweeper game but this seems very time-consuming and I need to set my main focus on the algorithm. I need to find solutions fast. The mentor said that a complete game of Minesweeper isn't needed and that I only needed to generate a field for the algorithm to work with, but I'm not entirely sure how this works.

## What's next

Firstly I need to figure out the board problem. After that I'll probably start looking into the subject more thoroughly and explore different ways of fulfilling the logical aspect of the algorithm. Also I need to create the data-structures required for the algorithm to work.

Time used this week: **15 hours**
