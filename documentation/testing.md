# Testing document

## JUnit testing

The testing of the functions and classes are only done when it is seen to be necessary or when it's functionality is in question (uncertain). 

More data will be put here when it is accumulated

## Empirical testing

The following results come from testing the method generateField() from the Gamefield -class. This information was gathered by starting a timer, calling the function and ending the timer once the method has finished executing. I tested with differnt sizes and number of mines.

| Width x Height | Mines        | Time (ms)  |
| -------------  |:------------:| ----------:|
| 100 x 100      | 150          | 6ms        |
| 250 x 250      | 350          | 9ms        |
| 500 x 500      | 1000         | 28ms       | 
| 1000 x 1000    | 2500         | 40ms       |
